# PHP7 Design Patterns

**Creational design patterns** provide several mechanisms to create objects.

## Creational

* [AbstractFactory](AbstractFactory)
mechanism creates serias of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

* [Builder](Builder)
mechanism creates a complex object step by step.

* [FactoryMethod](FactoryMethod)
mechanism uses subclasses, with the same interface, to create an object in deferent ways.

* [Prototype](Prototype)
mechanism creates an object similar to an existing one, by copying it and modifying it a little bit.

* [SimpleFactory](SimpleFactory)
mechanism creates an instance of an object, that is part of a group objects with the same interface.

* [Singleton](Singleton)
mechanism creates only one instance of an object that will handle all calls.

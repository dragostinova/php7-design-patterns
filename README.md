# PHP7 Design Patterns

**Design patterns** are typical solutions to common problems in software design. This is a simple implementation of known design patterns in PHP7.

## Installation
You should install dependencies with `Composer` first:

```bash
$ composer install
```

Read more about how to install and use `Composer` on your local machine [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

You can run the example (the index file) of each design pattern or run the tests by category using `phpunit`:

```bash
$ phpunit -c "phpunit.xml" --testsuite creational
$ phpunit -c "phpunit.xml" --testsuite structural
$ phpunit -c "phpunit.xml" --testsuite behavioral
```

## Design Patterns

Design patterns can be structured in roughly three different categories:

### [Creational](Creational)

### [Structural](Structural)

### [Behavioral](Behavioral)
